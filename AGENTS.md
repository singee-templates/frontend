# Repository Guidelines for AI

This file provides guidance to AI Code Agent when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Source lives in `src/`. Global routing is defined in `src/router.tsx`, with route modules in `src/routes` (`__root.tsx` for layout, `index.tsx` for the landing page). Shared UI composites belong in `src/components`, design primitives in `src/ui`. Styling overrides sit in `src/styles.css`. Static files stay in `public/`, and production artifacts are written to `dist/` and `.output/`. Colocate new feature assets with the component or route that consumes them to keep dependencies obvious.

- UI: Mantine v8. Use the context7 MCP tool with the library id `/mantine/mantine` to load docs.
- Routing: TanStack Start/Router. Use context7 with `/websites/tanstack_com-start-latest` for Start docs and `/websites/tanstack_router` for Router docs.
- Generated files like `routeTree.gen.ts` are auto-created; do not edit.

## Build & Development Commands

Use pnpm for everything. `pnpm dev` starts the Vite dev server on port 3000 with hot reload. `pnpm build` emits the optimized bundle into `.output/`, while `pnpm preview` runs the Nitro server from `.output/` to sanity-check SSR. `pnpm check:types` runs `tsc --noEmit`. `pnpm lint` applies the TanStack + React ESLint rules, and `pnpm format` runs Prettier then auto-fixes lint errors.

Testing uses Vitest:

- `pnpm test` runs `vitest run` via `vitest.config.ts` (intentionally isolated from the app's `vite.config.ts` plugins).
- `pnpm test --watch` runs Vitest in watch mode.
- `pnpm test:browser` runs Browser Mode component tests (Playwright provider) via `vitest.browser.config.ts`.
- The default test environment is `node` (use `// @vitest-environment jsdom` for React component tests).

Browser Mode notes:

- Test file pattern: `src/**/*.browser.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`
- Setup file: `vitest.browser.setup.ts`
- If Chromium is missing locally, install it with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`

Before declaring any Agent task complete, re-run `pnpm check:types` and `pnpm format` and ensure both commands pass cleanly.

## ESLint

ESLint 9 flat config is used (`eslint.config.js`). The configuration extends `@tanstack/eslint-config` and adds React-specific rules via `eslint-plugin-react`.

Key React rules enforced (errors):

- `react/button-has-type` - buttons must have an explicit `type` attribute
- `react/self-closing-comp` - components without children must self-close
- `react/jsx-curly-brace-presence` - no unnecessary curly braces in JSX
- `react/jsx-boolean-value` - omit `={true}` for boolean props
- `react/jsx-fragments` - use `<>` syntax for fragments
- `react/no-children-prop` - don't pass children as a prop

Run `pnpm lint` to check for errors. ESLint errors are blocking and must be fixed before committing.

## Prettier

Prettier config lives in `prettier.config.js`:

- `semi: true` - always use semicolons
- `singleQuote: true` - use single quotes for strings
- `trailingComma: 'all'` - trailing commas everywhere

Run `pnpm format` to format and fix lint errors in one step (runs Prettier then ESLint --fix).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write TypeScript React function components. Prettier enforces semicolons, single quotes, and trailing commas—never hand-format around it.

Use PascalCase for components (`DashboardCard.tsx`), camelCase for hooks/utilities. Mantine styles should live beside their component, leveraging Mantine's theming utilities before reaching for raw CSS.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Commits should mirror the existing short, imperative pattern (`use mantine components for index page`). Keep changes scoped and meaningful. PRs must include: a concise summary, linked issue/ticket, before/after screenshots for UI work, and confirmation that `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check:types` passed. Mention any config or env changes up front so reviewers can reproduce.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Secrets belong in `.env.local` (gitignored); reference them through Vite's `import.meta.env`. Run `lefthook install` once so git hooks catch lint regressions pre-push. Document any third-party scripts or analytics additions in the PR, including CSP or token requirements.

## Notes

1. Prefer Mantine components and styles; avoid unnecessary custom CSS.
2. Extract custom components into the `src/components/` directory (and then you can import them with `~components/`); use CSS Modules for each component's styles.
3. Always use English when writing code, comments, and documentation.

## Dependencies / Tools

### Mantine

The project uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) v8 for UI components. Use the context7 MCP tool with the library id `/mantine/mantine` to load (or search) docs.

### Tanstack Start

The project uses [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/) for routing. Use the context7 MCP tool with the library id `/websites/tanstack_com-start-latest` to load (or search) docs.

### Tanstack Router

Tanstack Start uses the Tanstack Router under the hood. Use the context7 MCP tool with the library id `/websites/tanstack_router` to load (or search) docs.

### @mantine/hooks

Use [@mantine/hooks](https://mantine.dev/hooks/getting-started/) for common React hooks. Prefer these over writing custom hooks when available.

**Note:** Do NOT use `useClipboard` from @mantine/hooks. Use `copy-to-clipboard` instead (see below).

### copy-to-clipboard

Use [copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard) for clipboard operations:

```tsx
import copy from 'copy-to-clipboard';

copy('Text to copy');
copy(text, { format: 'text/plain' });
```

### @mantine/modals

Use [@mantine/modals](https://mantine.dev/x/modals/) for declarative modal management. The ModalsProvider is already configured in `__root.tsx`.

### TanStack Query (React Query)

Use [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for server state management and data fetching. Use the context7 MCP tool with the library id `/tanstack/query` to load (or search) docs.

Prefer `useQuery` / `useMutation` / `useSuspenseQuery` / `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` for data fetching. **Do NOT use `useEffect` + `useState` to fetch data.** TanStack Query provides built-in caching, background refetching, error handling, and loading states.

#### Integrating with Route Loaders

TanStack Query can be combined with TanStack Router's `loader` / `beforeLoad` for optimal data fetching:

1. **Define query options** using `queryOptions()` for reuse between loader and component
2. **Preload in loader** using `queryClient.ensureQueryData(options)` (awaits data) or `queryClient.prefetchQuery(options)` (non-blocking)
3. **Consume in component** using `useSuspenseQuery(options)` to automatically use cached data

Recommended patterns:

- Use `ensureQueryData` in loader for critical data that must be available before render
- Use `prefetchQuery` (without await) for slower/non-critical data, then wrap component in `<Suspense>` to handle loading
- Access `queryClient` from route context: `loader: ({ context: { queryClient } }) => ...`
- Always reuse the same `queryOptions` in both loader and component to ensure cache hits

### dayjs

Use [dayjs](https://day.js.org/) for date manipulation. It's a lightweight alternative to moment.js.

### Zod

Use [Zod](https://zod.dev/) v4 for schema validation. Prefer Zod for form validation and API response parsing.

### Sonner

The project uses [Sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/) for toast notifications instead of @mantine/notifications. Import `toast` from `sonner` to show notifications:

```tsx
import { toast } from 'sonner';

toast.success('Success message');
toast.error('Error message');
toast.info('Info message');
toast.warning('Warning message');
toast.loading('Loading...');
toast.promise(promise, {
  loading: 'Loading...',
  success: 'Done!',
  error: 'Error!',
});
```

### Context7

If you need to get some other documentations that you don't know exactly, you can use the context7 mcp tool.
